"""
Authentication utilities for launching a Playwright browser and logging into the SPA.

This module exposes a single function `login_to_spa` that:
- Starts Playwright (Chromium).
- Launches a browser with a maximized window (headless mode controlled via configuration).
- Creates a browser context with HTTP Basic Authentication and a full-screen viewport.
- Navigates to the login URL and waits for the page to be fully loaded.
- Handles common UI pop-ups such as newsletter and cookie banners when present.

It returns both the Browser and Page instances for subsequent navigation and actions.

def login_to_spa():
    """
    Launch a Chromium browser via Playwright, authenticate using HTTP Basic Auth,
    navigate to the configured SPA login URL, and return the Browser and Page objects.

    Behavior:
    - Headless mode is controlled by the HEADLESS configuration.
    - The browser launches maximized and creates a context with HTTP Basic Auth using
      the configured USERNAME and PASSWORD.
    - The function navigates to LOGIN_URL and waits for the network to be idle.
    - Attempts best-effort dismissal of optional UI elements (newsletter banner and
      cookie consent for "Accept only essential cookies") if they appear.
    - Prints status messages for diagnostics.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - browser (playwright.sync_api.Browser): The launched Chromium Browser instance.
            - page (playwright.sync_api.Page): The active Page within the authenticated context.

    Raises:
        This function internally catches exceptions related to navigation/authentication
        and prints diagnostic messages. In case of failure, it still returns the
        (browser, page) pair if available so the caller can decide on next steps.

    Side Effects:
        - Starts Playwright and launches a browser process.
        - Prints diagnostic output to stdout.
        - May interact with and dismiss certain pop-ups on the target page.

    Example:
        browser, page = login_to_spa()
        # Use the returned page for further navigation...
